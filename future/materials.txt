Allow for different types of materials with different properties and costs.

Rare materials may be required for some components.

Use a normalized curve to define scarity of raw materials on a planet.
From this you can calculate cost based on that scarcity.

For example:
Material for a coupling is 
    70% material index 0.1372
    20% material index 0.4884
    10% material index 0.9884
