For the first version there are only two types of drives FTL and sublight.

Specific Impulse is measured in seconds, it means how long can a 1g acceleration be maintained for the initial mass of fuel with the given engine.
    - Honestly this doesn't make sense to me as I think so many things could be effect the outcome
    For example just having more fuel should mean I can burn longer right?
    The only thing that could make it work is that to keep the acceleration constant adding fule means you have to burn at a higher initial rate, in fact the rate you burn drops off as the fuel is consumed.

Future versions will consider different types of drives as follows:

FTL
    hyperspace
        drive is moderately heavy
        complex so costly to make
        light fuel
        with these types the energy is spent transitioning into and out of hyperspace, actually moving around is negligible
    
    warp
        drive is moderately heavy
        complex so costly to make
        light fuel but guzzles it continuously
        these types operate in normal space and needs lots of energy to move

    wormhole
        drive  is very heavy
        very complex
        uses almost no fuel as the wormhole provides lots of energy
        travel is near instantaneous

Sublights
    chemical 
        drive is very light
        fuel massive
        basic liquid/solid rocket
        Say force is around 10,000,000 per kg of mass (let this be x)

    ion 
        drove is very light
        simple and cheap
        fuel is very light
        thrust is very low
        force is 5x? (per unit of mass just very slow)
    
    fission 
        drive is moderately heavy if shielding people light otherwise
        fuel is very heavy
        force is 25x

    fusion 
        drive is heavy
        fuel is light
        force is 125x

    antimatter
        drive is very heavy
        very complex
        fuel vvery light
        force 100,000x
